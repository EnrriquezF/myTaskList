# myTaskList!

A task list webpage made as a project for a UTN course.

Design: I made the whole design in Figma, using a warm orange palette to stimulate energy in the user. Used a sass stylesheet.
Development: Made with ReactJS + Vite, it's hooks, and vanilla JS. As the project is solely based on the client side, it relied on localStorage.
